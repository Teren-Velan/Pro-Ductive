## About The Project


As part of my Fourth project at General Assembly, I created a Productivity Web-App.

Pro-ductive is a web app that has multiple functions like expense tracker, calender, journal and to-do list.

This was my first attempt at building a web app using Python and Django Framework.

### Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)


## Usage

The webapp consist of 3 main components:
1.Diary
2.Expense Tracker
3.Calender

*Each will be further elaborated with images below*

### 1. Diary

<p> Diary allows users to log their day to day activities in an e-journal </p>

As the diary was the first component i worked on, i looked indepth into the Django's MVT(Model View Template) design pattern and understood how all of them work together.


### 2.Expense tracker

With the expense tracker, users are able to input the date of expense and the amount and keep track of it. They are also able to set the date range of which they wish to see the expenses for.

Key learning pointer from this was being able to manipulate data with Python and working with DateTime.

### 3.Calender

With the Calender app, users are able to block off dates they have plans and have an overview look of their events

Key learning pointer from this was working with DateTime in Python is alot more easier than Date in Javascript. It was encriching to be able to manipulate data easily with python.
